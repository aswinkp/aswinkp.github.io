Hello, I'm Aswin Kumar.

Polyglot Programmer. Freelancer. Open Source enthusiast. Currently Full Stack Developer at RedBlackTree. Live in Chennai, India.

Started to sharpen my coding skills in my sophomore year, Began my professional career as a Software Developer in Citrisys Solutions as Software Developer in [ATG Framework](http://learnoracleatg.blogspot.in/2014/04/chapter-1-oracle-atg-story.html). Now I work at RedBlackTree as a FullStack Developer (Python). Being a individual freelancer or hobbyist programmer developed some serious projects, ranging from highly scalable websites with great SEOs and heavy micro-data scoring over 95% in Google Page insights tool to Hybrid Mobile Application, I consider myself as a <del>reasonably</del> experienced Web Developer.

Code in Python (Django to be specific), Java, Rails, Meteor, Angular2, Cordova. But not limited to the above. I believe that technology/language is not a barrier for a good programmer. I love automating things. I follow 

> If you do it once, great. If you do it twice, frown. If you do it three times, automate it.
